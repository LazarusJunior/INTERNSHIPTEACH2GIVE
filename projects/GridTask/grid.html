<p style="font-weight: bold;">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every pennyâ€™s worth.</p>
   <p> "I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best and most grueling time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."

   <p style="font-weight: bold;">The team was very supportive and kept me motivated.</p> <p>"I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills. I now work as a mobile engineer for a big company. This was one of the best investments I've made in myself."

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Such a life changing experience. Highly recommended! </p>
<p>"Before joining the bootcamp, I had never written a line of code. 
    I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step.
    I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. 
    The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance.
    The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have.
    In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. 
    It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was easy.</p>
<p>"The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress, which I find really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people."
